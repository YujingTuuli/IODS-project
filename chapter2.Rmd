*Week 1*

Following the detail instruction in "Start me up", I set up the technical platforms needed in this course, including R, RStudio, and GitHub. Following the teacher's instruction, I got the know how to push the updated script to the GitHub. Then I started the learning of R with the book "R for Health Data Science", and the corresponding exercise 1. In this week, I finished the learning of Chapter 1-5 in the book, which was a heavy and time-consuming task, but rewarding! In addition, I read the recommended Part 1 of the textbook "MABS4IODS", and the two webinars on RStudio and GitHub.
